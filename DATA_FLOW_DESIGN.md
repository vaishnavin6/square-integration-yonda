**Data Design Flow for Square Integration with Yonda**

**1. Payment Transactions via Square**

	Step 1: Payment Initiation                -  A customer initiates a payment using Square on the e-commerce platform.
	Step 2: Payment Processing                -  Square processes the transaction and captures payment details.
	Step 3: Data Transmission to Yonda        -  Square sends transaction data to Yonda via API.
	Step 4: Data Storage and Tax Calculation  -  Yonda securely stores the transaction data and calculates applicable sales tax.

**2. Refunds via Square**

	Step 1: Refund Request        -  The e-commerce platform initiates a refund request through Square’s API.
	Step 2: Refund Processing     -  Square processes the refund and updates transaction records.
	Step 3: Data Update           -  Square sends the updated refund data to Yonda, where tax calculations are adjusted accordingly.

**3. Partial Payments via Square**

  	Step 1: Partial Payment Request   -  Multiple partial payments are processed through Square.
	Step 2: Payment Confirmation      -  Square confirms each payment, updating the transaction status.
	Step 3: Data Aggregation          -  Yonda aggregates the payment data for accurate tax calculation.

**4. Enhanced Security Measures**

	•	Tokenization		-	Implement tokenization for all sensitive payment data to minimize exposure.
	•	Advanced Encryption	-	Use AES-256 encryption for all data in transit and at rest to ensure maximum security.

**5. Intelligent Error Handling**

	•	Predictive Analysis    -  Utilize predictive analytics to preemptively identify and mitigate potential errors.
	•	Custom Retry Logic     -  Implement adaptive retry mechanisms based on the type of error encountered (e.g., exponential backoff).

**6. Comprehensive Logging and Monitoring**

	•	Centralized Logging    -  Use tools like ELK Stack or Splunk for centralized logging and real-time monitoring.
	•	Real-Time Alerts       -  Set up real-time alerts for critical errors or security breaches with tools like PagerDuty or OpsGenie.
